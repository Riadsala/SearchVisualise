\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Mental imagery, also referred to as visualising, is the phenomenon where by 
We are going to replicate \cite{reinhart2015}. We will also test if the study generalises. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Experiment 1}
\label{sec:exp1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The aim of this experiment is to directly replicate the visualisation effect in visual search \citep{reinhart2015}. We have made two minor changes to the original paradigm: (i) we have removed the red distracter elemenet used in the original study to control for EEG effects. (ii). We will use runs of length three, four and five, rather than three, five and seven. This was done as runs of longer length are unimportant for testing the critical result: that reaction times for trial three in a run will be faster in the visualise condition than those in the practise condition. 

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}

30 participants will be recruited via from \ldots from the University of Aberdeen. All participants will have normal or corrected-to-normal vision. 

The sample size of $n=30$ is based on a power analysis for a one-tailed paired $t$-test, with a power of 0.9 and effect size of $d=0.55$.This should be sufficient for the replication given the original effect sizes of $0.61<d<0.72$ ($n=18$).


\subsubsection{Stimuli}

The search stimuli consisted of twelve Landolt Cs arranged in a circle (radius $x^{\circ}$) around a central fixation cross. The Landolt C's had a radius of $x^{\circ}$ and had one of eight possible orientations ($\phi=n\frac{\pi}{4}$, $n=0,\ldots,7$). One of the C's was coloured green which indicated that it was the target. An example stimulus is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:exp1stimulus}.

\section{Experiment 2}
\label{sec:exp2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The aim of experiment two is to investigate whether the effect reported by \cite{reinhart2015} applies to more standard visual search paradigms, or if it is specific to the target matching task they used in their original study. Hence, in this study we remove the colour cue from the stimuli and change the observer's task from 'does the green item match the target template?' to 'is the taret present of absent in this stimulus?.'
